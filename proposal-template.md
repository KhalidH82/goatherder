# Goat Herder Proposal

## What is Goat Herder?

The name of my game is called Goat Herder. This game is based on memory and is layed out on a 5X5 board which will contain 10 images with a matching pair. The objective of the game is to herd all the goats until the entire board is flipped over and all the goats have found a match.

## Wireframe

Included in images folder under goatwire file.

## Initial thoughts on game structure

Some challenges I believe I will encounter is using animations to simulate a card being flipped over. I would also need the cards to stay flipped over when matched and turn back over when not. Another challenge I may come into is resizing the images to fit inside the cards at the same width and height of div. Lastly, I would need to randomize the images on the cards everytime the board is reset. I would like to add some sound effects and possibly an option for two people to play on a larger board where the player with most matches win. I would like to make this game responsive to the broswer window.

## Phases of Completion

2/2 - Complete HTML/CSS layout and styling. Create board and randomize board functions in Javascript/jQuery.<br>
2/3 - Complete all logic in Javascript/jQuery.<br>
2/5-2/6 -Refactor code and possibly add option for two player and a score board.

## Links and Resources

I plan on using the following links as resources, referencing our previous labs and homework, and official documentations for languages or frameworks used.
