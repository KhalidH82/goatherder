# Project-1-Goat-Herder
Goat Herder memory game

The name of my game is called Goat Herder and it is a homage to our WDI class. This game features a one player as well as a two player mode where the user uses their memory to match pictures of goats. Goats are displayed when the the logo is clicked, but if match isn't made the cards will quickly flip back over.

Game Instructions

One Player

In the one player mode as you find matches the player moves to another level. At 2 matches the player reaches level 2, at 4 matches the player moves on the level 3, at 8 matches you reach level 4, and the game is completed at 10 matches. As matches are made they are updated on the scoreboard at the top of the page.

Two Player

In the two player mode, players take turns flipping cards over to find matches. Once matches are found are diplayed on the scoreboard at the top of the page on the score board. The first player to reach 5 matches wins the game.

Technologies Used

The technology I used to create my game is Vanilla JavaScript. I was also able to incorporate button animations, hover effects, and sounds to add some visual appeal and creativity to my game. My approach was to create a functional game and then I started adding features to make it more complex. Once that was finished I styled the game and also resolved some issues of unusual behavior when user double clicks on images and the speed the cards were being flipped. Lastly I refactored my code, removed all console.logs, and inserted comments which describe each function.
